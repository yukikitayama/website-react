## React Note

### React Hooks

- Hooks are something starting with `use`.
  - Such as `useState, useEffect, useReducer, ...`
- Only used in React components, which are JavaScript functions returning JSX.
  - Don't use in a normal JavaScript function.
- Use right below the React component declaration (top-level).
  - Don't use in a nested React Hook functions.
  - Don't use in a if statement.

### Side Effect

- `Side effect` is any functionality except the main React jobs such as rendering interface components and reacting to user inpute.
  - Examples of side effect is storing data in browser storage, sending HTTP requests and setting timers.

### Effect Hook

- `Effect hook` Contains the functions executed after every component evaluation if the dependencies changed.
- `useEffect(() => { ... }, [ dependencies ]);`
- Dependencies can omit React `useState()` functions.
- If dependency array is empty the useEffect() runs only once when the component is rendered.
- If there is not even empty dependency array, the function runs every time a component changes, so it's a rare use case.

### useReducer()

- `useReducer()` is a replacement for `useState()` to manage a more complex state.
- `const [state, dispatchFunction] = useReducer(reducterFunction, initialState, initialFunction);`
  - Dispatch function triggers an update of the state.
  - Reducer function receives the latest state and action to produce a new state, triggered by dispatch function.
- Group the related multiple states and actions.

### Context API

- Make component-wide state storage.
- `const SomeContext = React.createContext({ ... });`
  - Default object for the context
  - Used in `useContext( ... );`
- Context provider
```javascript
const SomeContextProvider = (props) => {
  return (
    <SomeContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      {props.children}
    </SomeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
  - Defines functions and states inside
- Limitation
  - Not optimized for high frequency changes.
    - Redux is better
